If we only need one employee with most orders:

GROUP BY Orders.EmployeeID
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 1;

If we want all the employees with most orders:

SELECT LastName
FROM Orders
LEFT JOIN Employees
ON Orders.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID
GROUP BY Orders.EmployeeID
HAVING Count(*) = (
	SELECT Max(ordercount) 
	FROM (
		SELECT Count(*) as ordercount
		FROM Orders
		GROUP BY EmployeeID
	)
)
