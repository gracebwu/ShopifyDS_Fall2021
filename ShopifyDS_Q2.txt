Q2.
a) How many orders were shipped by Speedy Express in total?

SELECT Count(*)
FROM Orders 
LEFT JOIN Shippers 
ON Orders.ShipperID = Shippers.ShipperID
WHERE ShipperName = "Speedy Express"

Result: 54

b) What is the last name of the employee with the most orders?

SELECT LastName
FROM Orders
LEFT JOIN Employees
ON Orders.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID
GROUP BY Orders.EmployeeID
HAVING Count(*) = (
	SELECT Max(ordercount) 
	FROM (
		SELECT Count(*) as ordercount
		FROM Orders
		GROUP BY EmployeeID
	)
)

Note: The reason I chose to use nested subqueries instead of an 
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 1 is because this method returns all the 
last names corresponding to the max orders if there is more than one
employee with the same number of orders.

Result: Peacock

c) What product was ordered the most by customers in Germany?

SELECT ProductName
FROM Orders
LEFT JOIN Customers
ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID
LEFT JOIN OrderDetails
ON Orders.OrderID = OrderDetails.OrderID
LEFT JOIN Products
ON OrderDetails.ProductID = Products.ProductID
WHERE Country = "Germany"
GROUP BY Products.ProductID
HAVING sum(Quantity) = (
	SELECT max(sumorders) 
	FROM (
		SELECT sum(Quantity) as sumorders
		FROM Orders
		LEFT JOIN Customers
		ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID
		LEFT JOIN OrderDetails
		ON Orders.OrderID = OrderDetails.OrderID
		WHERE Country = "Germany"
		GROUP BY ProductID
	)
)

Note: The reason I chose to use nested subqueries instead of an 
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 1 is because this method returns all the 
products corresponding to the max quantity if there is more than one
product with the same total order quantity.

Result: Boston Crab Meat
